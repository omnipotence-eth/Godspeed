# Tesla Tire Wear Prediction Model with Claude AI

## Full Transparency: This model is a theoretical concept, built to expand and explore what is possible with Telematics & Ai.

## Project Description
This project simulates tire wear for various Tesla models and uses machine learning models to predict tire wear. It also incorporates Claude AI for analysis and recommendations on tire longevity.

## Key Features
- Simulates tire wear for different Tesla models under various conditions
- Implements multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network) for tire wear prediction
- Uses an ensemble approach to combine predictions from different models
- Integrates Claude AI for analyzing tire replacement scenarios and providing tire longevity tips
- Visualizes model accuracy and residuals

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
